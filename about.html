                <p>In the late 1970’s I was a young mother living on an
                island north of Seattle in Washington State and my

                for months at a time. The long stretches of time and 
                solitude allowed me to really focus on my weaving. 
                While keeping on eye on our young chillren I read 
                books about weaving and practiced on my loom. 
                Through trial and error was able to develop my abilities.</p>

                American inspired patterns. It was a rich time in our lives
