The header is all set.

Navigation for the mobile screens needs to be condensed: design file  -
navigation_mobile.design

The about page is close I just added an image of shuttles to the designs of both mobile and full size.
about_full_6_28.design
about_mobile_6_28.design

( I got some outlines on the different blocks of copy that weren't there before last time I checked the about page)

the index looks great (one more redo on the decor image for the mobile).
(not sure we want to put big color change on the hypertext - it may be fine as is)

Shawls and scarfs needs to have more items added and details of weaving were placed inside the photo of item. hmmmm if this is difficult to do I can do this on my end and send you integrated images.
Let me know.
